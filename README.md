# **NeoAttend**

## **📌 Project Features**

* Automatically detects and recognizes students through the webcam and records attendance with the correct date and time.
* Saves a photo of each recognized student for proof, validation, and **anti-spoofing review**, allowing teachers to verify if the image was taken live or from a phone screen.
* Allows users to register students, validate their information, and capture images directly through the webcam for recognition.
* Displays recorded attendance in a table and allows saving daily attendance into a CSV file for easy tracking and documentation.
* Includes tools to edit or delete student information — deleting a student also removes their stored images to keep files organized.
* Shows a live clock and date on the main window for easy monitoring.
