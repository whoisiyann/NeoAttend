__“NeoAttend”__

_Project Features_

> Automatically detects and recognizes students through the webcam and records their attendance with the correct date and time.

> Saves a photo of each recognized student during attendance for proof of entry, validation, and anti-spoofing review, allowing teachers to verify if the image was taken live or from a phone screen.

> Allows users to register students, validate their information, and capture images directly through the webcam for recognition.

> Displays recorded attendance in a table and lets users save daily attendance into a CSV file for easy tracking and documentation.

> Includes tools to edit or delete student information. When a student is removed, their stored images are also deleted automatically to keep the files clean.

> Shows live clock and date on the main window for easy monitoring.
