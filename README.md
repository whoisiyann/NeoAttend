NeoAttend GUI PROJECT

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project focuses on developing an attendance monitoring system that uses face recognition technology to record and manage student attendance automatically. Instead of using manual sign-in sheets or ID cards, the system will identify students through their facial features. This will make the process faster, more accurate, and less prone to cheating or proxy attendance. The system is designed specifically for schools and universities to ensure a more reliable way of tracking student presence in class.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Traditional methods of recording attendance—such as roll calls, logbooks, or ID scanning—are often time-consuming, inaccurate, and vulnerable to misuse. To address these issues, this project proposes a Face Recognition Based Attendance Monitoring System that automatically verifies and records student attendance using facial biometrics. A camera will capture student images at the start of the class, and the system will match them against the stored database. The recorded attendance will be updated in real-time, and teachers can easily generate attendance reports. This system aims to reduce errors, save time, and promote fairness in monitoring student attendance.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:

To Eliminate manual errors in attendance recording by using automated face recognition.
To Save time during classes by reducing the need for roll calls or manual sign-ins.
To Prevent cheating such as proxy attendance or ID misuse.
To Provide accurate and real-time reports for teachers and school administrators.
To Promote fairness and accountability in tracking student presence.

PROJECT FEATURES:

Automated face recognition for quick and accurate student identification
Real-time attendance recording and database updates
Student database management (add, edit, and remove student records)
Attendance reports and analytics for teachers and administrators
Secure and reliable system to prevent proxy or false attendance
